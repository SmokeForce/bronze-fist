# Introduction

Here are some notes on how to install and run this service either
in Heroku or locally. Unless you have access to the non-public 
library which backs this service, you can stop reading now since 
you will not have everything you need to actually run it.

# Local Service

To use locally, install a new virtual machine using virtualenv.

> virtualenv -p <python3> <directory>
> source <directory>/bin/activate.sh

Next install the dependencies using pip, e.g.

> pip install -r requirements.txt

Now you can run the service locally, e.g.:

> python generator/service.py

# Heroku Service

If you want deploy to Heroku (http://heroku.com), you will need to
obtain an account, configure your environment and create a new
service project to deploy this service to (see Heroku site
documentation).
